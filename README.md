📊 DDoS SHAP Pilot Analysis
Overview

This repository contains a pilot exploratory analysis of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) network traffic data. The aim of this pilot is to inspect dataset structure, examine class distribution, and establish an initial workflow for applying SHAP-based explainability to tree-based machine learning models.

This work represents an early-stage analysis intended to inform and refine subsequent modelling and explainability experiments in a larger research project.

Objectives of the Pilot Study

The specific goals of this pilot analysis are to:

Inspect the structure and dimensionality of a DDoS traffic dataset

Examine the distribution of benign and attack traffic labels

Perform basic preprocessing and binary label creation

Prepare the groundwork for applying SHAP explanations to tree-based models

Identify potential data quality or imbalance issues before full experimentation

No final models or performance claims are made at this stage.
