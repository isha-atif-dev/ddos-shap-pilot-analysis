📊 DDoS SHAP Pilot Analysis
Overview

This repository contains a pilot exploratory analysis of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) network traffic data. The aim of this pilot is to inspect dataset structure, examine class distribution, and establish an initial workflow for applying SHAP-based explainability to tree-based machine learning models.

This work represents an early-stage analysis intended to inform and refine subsequent modelling and explainability experiments in a larger research project.
